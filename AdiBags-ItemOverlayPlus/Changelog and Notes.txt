Changelog by Sattva 2nd May 2023 #1;
- Initial backport and modification of addon initially made by apottere for retail game version.
- Added Caching of already scanned items.
- A lot of optimization to not bother user FPS.
- Fixed issues when overlay was removed by clicking an item in bag or while looting with bag open. And more fixes!
- Added option to disable overlay in /adibags - Modules - Item Overlay Plus.

Known issues: 
For now i have implemented optimized way to scan the toltips, so that this module doesn't bother your game FPS.
	Sometimes when new item adding the overlay for NEW items could become a little messy, no biggie. But overlay is updated by clicking "Reset new item" (N) button, or TidyBags (T) button, or reloading game. If you have Tidy-Bags semi-automated then it's gonna be updated also by visiting different NPCs such as vendors, even mail.
It's just something that has to be worked on, and will be for sure improved in future, if people be interested in this modification.

To-Do List:	
Add different ways to handle the scanning process.
Make options for user to be able to decide which kind of scan does he want, fastest or optimized one. 
Optimize caching. 
Add green overlay for recipes - already learned.
